"""Source-grounded Telegram summarizer.

Deterministic, conservative summarization for every important
story.  A 2-8 sentence summary is composed from facts extracted
from the available source material:

    1. clean    - the existing editorial cleaning/filtering
                  pipeline (boilerplate, filler, headline
                  paraphrase, dedup, conflict) runs first;
    2. facts    - what happened, who/what is involved, where,
                  when, important numbers, consequences are
                  extracted from each surviving sentence;
    3. compose  - fact-important sentences are selected
                  (2-8), article text is the primary source
                  when article extraction is available, and
                  only conservative fact-preserving rewrites
                  (trailing attribution fronting) are applied;
    4. verify   - every fact token and every sentence tail
                  must exist verbatim in the source text;
    5. quality  - completeness, artifacts, truncation,
                  headline repetition and duplication checks.

Nothing is ever invented: the summary contains only facts that
exist in the source, phrased in the source's own words.  A
story with fewer than two genuinely useful source-supported
sentences is rejected.

# closing quote, whitespace, Capitalized word") into its own row

# sentences - where no closing quote precedes the boundary - are
